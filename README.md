# AI Connector for Revit (Beta)

The **AI Connector for Revit** connects AI Desktop Apps (like Claude or Cursor) with Revit. Rather than generating new Revit code, the AI uses a set of 36 predefined commands to inspect and select elements based on model feedback.

---

## Features

- **36 Predefined Tools**  
  - Inspect parameters, family sizes, sheets and views, and more  
  - Examples:  
    - Get the value of a parameter  
    - Determine the file size of a family  
    - List views placed on a sheet  

- **Feedback-Driven Interaction**  
  The AI invokes your tools and adapts to Revit’s responses, reducing errors from hand-crafted code.

- **Read & Select Only (Phase 1)**  
  Model reading, inspection, and element selection  
  (Write operations will be added in a later release.)

- **Integration with Nonicatab**  
  A new “AI Connector” button appears in the Nonicatab ribbon after installation, and selecting the ready-to-use toolbar or tool.

## Prerequisites

- **Autodesk Revit** 2025 or 2026 
- **Nonicatab** Revit plugin (Pro or Free). 
- **Claude Desktop App or Cursor**
